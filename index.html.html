        <br/>
        
        <p>A man; a fine man. A man dressed in PJs and a robe. Armed with a cup of coffee, boisterous thoughts and a heart stopping smile. A man out on what was supposed to be an evening walk; except, it's midnight and he's at the train station with a ticket out of town.</p>
        
        <p>He pulls out his phone from his robe's right pocket, quickly glancing at the time as he unlocks it; 00:37. 8 mins to take off. Deft fingers, fired by muscle memory, weave around the app list, finding the music app. One fluid move sends a torrent of music from <i>the sweet river</i> playlist down the bluetooth earphones.</p>
        
        <!-- I love my Dad and Mom so so much. Next to God, I love my family the most -->
                
        <p>One click <i>'Home'</i> sends him back to the home page on his cell were he's greeted with; </p>

        <p style="color: white; background-color: firebrick;"> <i>Zech 14:7 It shall be one day which is known to the LORD- neither day nor night. But at evening time it shall happen That it will be light</i> </p>
        <p> <big>00:38</big></p>
        
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD5hIqeKNVE"> <i>"...Every seed needs the water before it grows out of the ground...",</i></a> the lyrics poured into him like water. He could definitely use some light and rain in his life, he thought as he flicked open the photo gallery. </p>
        
        <p>'Telegram Images' album was his first selection</p>

        <p>He chuckled at the hilarity of it as he scrolled on. </p>

        <p>His mind wandered to love as he sat in the train. "What really does love mean?"</p>

        <p>Once upon a little dream</p>
        <p>I laid wide awake on a beautiful, stary night</p>
        <p>I closed my eyes and tried to feel the Earth</p>
        <p>To float softly like the wind</p>
        <p>To twinkle like the million stars</p>
        <p>To glow like that magic crescent</p>
        <p>To join in the symphony of nature</p>
        <p>That spell binding symphony that ever beckons to my ever lonsome heart</p>
        <p>There I lay, poised</p>

        <p>An Elysian standing on a sea of shimmering light</p>
        <p>Elegant in everyway. Celestial.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>

        <p>You stopped me from melding with Earth and sky</p> -->
